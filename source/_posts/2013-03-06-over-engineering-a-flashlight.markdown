What feels like almost 2 years ago, [I backed a programmable flashlight](http://www.hexbright.com/) on [Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/527051507/hexbright-an-open-source-light).
While it took *substantially* longer than intended for it to get through the manufacturing process, I actually am quite happy to report that I received it in the mail a few weeks ago.  Here it is:

It is perhaps the single most over-engineered flashlight in existance.
The body is CNC machined aircraft-grade aluminum that's been hard annodized.
But, that's not what makes it the most over-engineered flashlight, this is:

Yes, that's a complete circuit board with microcontroller on it.
Not just *any* microcontroller, though, but an [Arduino](http://arduino.cc) compatible one.
This means that you can program the flashlight just like an Arduino, using the same simple coding environment you're used to.
Then, you just plug in your USB cable, and away you go.

Is it overkill? 
Is a rechargable flashlight with a three-axis accelerometer absurd? 
Yes, yes it is.
And that's why I love it.
It also happens to be the best flashlight I've ever seen, with a CREE XM-L U2 LED that puts out 500 lumens, and a beautiful total internal refraction lens.
