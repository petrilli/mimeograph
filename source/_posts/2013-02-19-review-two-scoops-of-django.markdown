A few weeks ago, [Audrey Roy](http://audreymroy.com/) and [Daniel Greenfield](http://pydanny.com/) [released the beta of their new book](https://django.2scoops.org/), <cite>Two Scoops of Django: Django Best Practices for Django 1.5</cite>.
Being a fan of Danny and Audrey's work, I obviously popped the $12 for it.
I read it in about a couple hours on the plane the next day.

Weighing in at approximately 200 pages, or approximately 1.52x10E-27 grams ([thanks information theory](http://www.scottkurowski.com/massbit/index.htm)) on my iPad, there is little fluff in the book, and that is a great thing. 
I've been using Django since v0.96 came out in early 2007, and use it for a majority of my web work, and yet the book contained a lot of interesting ideas and insight. 
The result of reading the book was a TODO list with many items on it for all my projects to address a lot of issues that I'd not really thought about.

What more do you want from a book than for it to make you rethink how you approach solving problems? Go buy it.
