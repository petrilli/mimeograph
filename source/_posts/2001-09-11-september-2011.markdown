In the wake of the overwhelming catastrophe the country has suffered today,
there will be many calls for monuments to remember those who have so
innocently given their lives, unwilling sacrificial lambs for Freedom. It is
in this most difficult of times that we must be clear of purpose, forward in
thought and focused in our actions. Only now, in the heart of darkness and
fear, do we find out the mettle of which this country is forged.

To step outside the present and plan for the future requires great humility,
clarity and perhaps just a bit of divine providence. Now is the moment to
redouble our efforts to continue this "great experiment" that began centuries
ago and is yet in its infancy.

Let us look forward and build not a morose memorial to the past, but a shining
beacon of light for the future. From the ruins of our buildings and through
our anger, we must rebuild with twice the passion with which they were
destroyed. We must build a new World Trade Center, one taller and prouder. We
must restore the Pentagon to the symbol of power that it represents. But more
importantly we must continue to build this great nation.

There is no greater memorial to the past than the future that springs forth
from it. Let our glorious future be the monument that marks our nationâ€™s pain.
