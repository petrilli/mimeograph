A [recent article](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/04/27/false-flags-sharia-law-and-gun-grabs-gop-lawmakers-embrace-the-crazy.html) in San Francisco's <cite>The Daily Beast</cite> came with the following quote that got me thinking:

<blockquote>The fact that conspiracy theories are percolating up to local party leaders and even the halls of Congress should be a warning sign for the GOP. As the faithful know, you reap what you sow, and the steady diet of hyperpartisan media has seeded these conspiracy theories in the minds of party activists to the extent that they are starting to shape policy debates. The embarrassing incidents are evidence of a larger problem that needs to be confronted: when you do not condemn the use of hate and fear to serve as a recruiting tool against your political opponents, the ability to reason together is undermined and self-government is compromised. There is a cost to condoning extremism when it seems to benefit “your team.”</blockquote>

Even <cite>The Economist</cite> has [weighed in](http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2012/06/georgia-and-united-nations) on the lunacy of the issue.

As much as it pains me to say, I think the Internet has amplified the crazy by allowing the lunatics among us to connect with each other and reinforce their belief system.
At some level, it is the basic "walled garden" cognitive bias, where people associate only with people who reinforce their belief system, thereby removing all doubt and thought from the process.
The Internet has simply allowed us to define our garden even more narrowly than ever before, and while this has benefited small groups that often felt isolated -- for example, people with a rare disease -- it has also increased the "echo chamber" effect.
From outside the wall, the system seems obviously broken, but from within, all is in harmony because any element that might undermine that harmony has been removed. 

Combine the dominant confirmation biases exhibited by most people -- and part of the reason people misunderstand science -- with things like the gambler's fallacy and herd instinct, and you have an environment ripe for exploitation. 
50 years ago, the lunatics were yelling on the street corner, and were largely ignored by society. 
The Internet gave them the ability to find their own "kind", and reinforce their beliefs, thereby creating a more monolithic social structure that can be used to garner perceived rationality. 

Or at least, that's my view.
