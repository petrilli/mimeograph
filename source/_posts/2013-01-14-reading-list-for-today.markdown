Another day, another few papers down:

* <cite>Disco: Running Commodity Operating Systems on Scalable Multiprocessors</cite> ([CiteSeerX](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.56.6674))
* <cite>End-to-end Arguments in Systems Design</cite> ([CiteSeerX](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.35.4167))
* <cite>Weighted Voting for Replicated Data</cite> ([CiteSeerX](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.12.6256))
* <cite>A Glossary of Time Granularity Concepts</cite> ([PDF](http://www.cs.arizona.edu/~rts/pubs/LNCS1399p406.pdf))
* <cite>An Access Control Model Supporting Periodicity Constraints and Temporal Reasoning</cite> ([CiteSeerX](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.25.9748))
* <cite>SharedDB: Killing One Thousand Queries With One Stone</cite> ([CiteSeerX](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.227.4609))

Some of these are quite old. 
For example, David Gifford's paper on weighted voting was published in 1979, but it set forth the beginning of weighted r+w quorums that are now quite common. 
I'm pretty sure I had read it before, but sometimes older papers just need to be re-read to make sure that no ideas were missed.
