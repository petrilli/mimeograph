For years, Stephen O'Grady, and his partner in crime and business, James Governor, have been telling anyone who will listen that the IT business is, and has been, undergoing a massive shift in power from the top-down of old to a new -- and sometimes terrifying -- bottom-up perspective.
These thoughts have been collected on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sogrady), his [blog](http://redmonk.com/sogrady/), and at every conference he spoke at and attended, including the excellent [Monktoberfest](http://monktoberfest.com/). 
For those who haven't had the opportunity to immerse themselves in the hoppy goodness of their leadership, Stephen's put a great compilation of those thoughts and themes together in a new book: [The New Kingmakers](http://thenewkingmakers.com/). 

First, it's necessary to say that this isn't some Alfred North Whitehead tome of inscrutable k≈çans.
Instead, it is written in a breezy and approachable style that masks the powerful themes contained; themes that are terrifying if you sit atop the old order.
As Mary Poppins says, a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down, and in this case the medicine is one that will empower entire new industries and bring others to their knees. 
The entire book revolves around the idea that developers -- and not managers and executives -- are the power brokers in the IT industry, and to a lesser extent that all things are IT. 
For those of us on the inside of this transformation, this seems a somewhat obvious observation in retrospect, but when Stephen first offered this idea in 2010 -- akin to Tim O'Reilly's early observation of the power of the alpha geeks in 2002 -- this wasn't as clear as it is now.
The near-alchemic combination of open source, the Internet, and its bastard love-child cloud computing, have rewritten the rules for everyone, whether they know it or not.

Do yourself a favor, take an hour out of your life to read Stephen's mini-book, and then spend many more hours thinking about what it all means to your world.
Like all good writing, it should leave you with more questions than you had when you started.
Use those questions to re-evaluate and re-shape your own future.

Oh, and did I mention that it's free? 
Thanks to the support of the team at [New Relic](http://www.newrelic.com), Stephen was able to get the book [edited and published for free by O'Reilly](http://redmonk.com/sogrady/2013/01/09/the-new-kingmakers-the-book/).
It really is a different world.
