Picture this: A young guy, riding his plastic crotch-rocket along the roads at
excessive speed, wearing nothing more protective than a pair of shorts and
flip flops, not even a pair of gloves to protect his hands from the dangers of
road impact. You see this often, and those of us who ride have a name for
them… "squids"? and it’s not in reference to their ability to multi-task
with multiple hands. These people -- a term that is generously applied in
this case -- give the rest of us a bad name, create a hazard for other riders
and generally dilute the gene pool with their faulty sense of self-
preservation. What drives otherwise potentially viable humans to do this? What
makes them think it’s â€œkoolâ€? and what makes them think that the rest of us
don’t laugh at them?

The other day, I was walking through Georgetown, on my way to some tasty
BBQ at Old Glory, and walked past a gaggle of these squids, flailing
about trying to impress one another with their stupendous acts of
unadultered stupidity. I could hear one talking about how he’d just
gotten his bike out of the shop, having had to replace all the plastic
on his (at most) 6 month old Yamaha R6, and how he’d narrowly missed an
oncomming car when trying to pass a car on the way into the city. Now
what exactly possesses these people? I want to know, so that I can
erradicate it from the planet.

My only wish is that eventually, they will all be dead, and that
hopefully they will manage to do it in a way that doesn’t take anyone
else with them, doesn’t burden an already swamped healthcare system, and
more importantly, doesn’t manage to destroy the joy of motorcycling for
the rest of usâ€”those who always ride with full gear, ride safely and
manage to not hit
