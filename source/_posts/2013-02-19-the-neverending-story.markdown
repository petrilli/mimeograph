Trying to catch up with my backlog of papers had been put on hold for a little bit as I tried to clean up a mess at work.
Perhaps more on that later.
Still, it seems like every paper I read somehow triggers a cascading avalanche of additional reading material, which means that the backlog never shrinks.

* <cite>Kafka: a Distributed Messaging System for Log Processing</cite> ([CiteSeerX](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.233.1726))
* <cite>Paxos Made Moderately Complex</cite> ([Cornell PDF](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs7412/2011sp/paxos.pdf))
* <cite>Pregel: A System for Large-Scale Graph Processing</cite> ([Github PDF](http://kowshik.github.com/JPregel/pregel_paper.pdf))
* <cite>Nonlinear Time-Series Prediction with Missing and Noisy Data</cite> ([CiteSeerX](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.44.1128))
* <cite>Bayesian Time Series: Models and Computations for the Analysis of Time Series in the Physical Sciences </cite> ([CiteSeerX](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.34.3587))
* <cite>Probabilistic Similarity Search for Uncertain Time Series</cite> ([CiteSeerX](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.160.8831))
* <cite>Processing a Trillion Cells per Mouse Click</cite> ([CiteSeerX](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.258.9554))
* <cite>Only Aggressive Elephants are Fast Elephants</cite> ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.0287))
* <cite>Uncertain Time-Series Similarity: Return to the Basics</cite> ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.1931))
* <cite>Statistical Distortion: Consequences of Data Cleaning</cite> ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.1932))

The last few are all from [VLDB 2012](http://www.vldb2012.org/), and I have another dozen or so papers from the same conference that I want to work my way through.
Looking at these, you can see that a lot of it is an attempt to deal with streams of data, specifically in real-time, as best as possible.
