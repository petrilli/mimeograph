My first digital camera was an [Apple Quicktake 200](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_QuickTake) that I bought in 1996.
It produced images in glorious 640x480 resolution, with a level of oversaturation that would make an 80s music video blush.
Soon after, I switched to another camera, a Canon point-and-shoot, but that also didn't really provide satisfactory results.
In late 2005, I bought a [Nikon D50](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikon_D50) digital SLR (DSLR) camera to get back into photography.
In purchasing the DSLR, I had looked at other cameras, and there simply had been nothing else that produced an image of any quality that could be used to make prints at 8x10 or above.
It wasn't just an issue of the sensor -- the megapixel war had started already -- but of the glass in front of the sensor, or plastic in some cases.

For a couple years, I used it extensively and took thousands of photos, but soon it became a bit of a hassle to keep with me.
The DSLR is a bulky camera structure, and when you go to take a picture, it can intimidate your subject if you're trying to take a picture of people.
It's a "serious camera", and comes with all the problems associated with it.

So, a couple years later, I bought a [Canon Powershot S90](http://www.kenrockwell.com/canon/s90.htm). 
While it might *look* like a simple point-and-shoot, but it was the first of a new generation of serious small cameras.
It had good glass (f/2 at its fastest), a lower resolution sensor that had very low noise levels and good low-light performance, and the ability to operate in full manual with the creation of RAW images.
The camera was pocketable in pants, and I took this camera with me all over the world, taking some amazing pictures with it.
There's 16x20 enlargements in my house from this camera that people have commented on repeatedly.
Just amazing.

But, it's time for somethng "new", and when a good friend bought a Fujifilm [X-Pro1](http://kenrockwell.com/fuji/x-pro1.htm), and started showing me the amazing work he was getting out of it, I started looking at the Fujifilm line of cameras.
One of the things I learned was that I actually mainly used a 35-50mm effective focal length on my lenses.
There is something freeing about not worrying about the lens.
My Nikon D50 has had a f/1.8 35mm lens (50mm effective) on it most of its life, and the zooms stay in the bag.

Then, miracle of miracles, Fujifilm announced the [X100S](http://fujifilm-x.com/x100s/en/), an update to one of the most well reguarded, and troubled camera released.
After a few days of research and thought, I decided to buy one from my favorite camera shop in NYC (B&H), and now the wait comes.
The hardest part is seeing reviews of the new X100S [start](http://www.fujirumors.com/x100s-vs-x100/) to [be released](http://www.briankraft.com/Blog/personal/fuji-x100s-pros-and-cons/), and how amazing the camera is looking.

Now, where's mine?
