This year was the first year I was able to attend [Strange Loop](http://www.thestrangeloop.com). 
Every other year it was held, something interfered. Sometimes it was work, and sometimes life. Regardless, I've resolved never to let that happen again. It has become -- by far -- my favorite conference. 
It blends humor, intelligence, and mind-bending ideas in a stew that is tasty, filling, and exhausting in the way that good discourse should be.

It's also the first year that conference was held in the [Peabody Opera House](http://peabodyoperahouse.com/), which provided a stunning backdrop for all the conversations.
How can you not marvel at Jeff Hawkins [brilliant talk](https://thestrangeloop.com/sessions/computing-like-the-brain) on "computing like the brain" delivered in a gilded City Beautiful creation?
The staff at the Peabody were gracious and helpful, and things ran as smoothly as any conference of that size can be expected to.


## Emerging Languages Camp

I arrived Saturday evening, in time to attend the Emerging Languages Camp on Sunday.
It was a small upcharge, as they say, to get a nice multi-course meal of interesting ideas and programming language theory (PLT).
While most all of the presentations were fascinating, a few stood out above all the others:

* [Symbiotic Languages: Transpiling into JavaScript](https://thestrangeloop.com/sessions/symbiotic-languages-transpiling-into-javascript).  One of the trends of the past few years has been targetting the JavaScript engines instead of CPU architectures.  While [Jeremy](https://twitter.com/jashkenas) talked mostly about [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/), the basic ideas hold true, and I think the overall push is to think of JavaScript as an easier target to craft new languages with, lowering the bar to entry substantially versus the traditional compiler requirements.
* [Elm: Making the Web Functional](https://thestrangeloop.com/sessions/elm-making-the-web-functional). A whirlwind tour of programming the web using a functional language called [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/). It's focused on creating graphical interfaces, and I think one of the things that interests me most is that it's a highly-interactive way to get people to think functionally. A great "first language" for kids, perhaps?  The syntax isn't as beautiful as a Lisp, but I think the interactivity of the graphical results makes for a great teaching tool to get people excited about programming.
* Datalog
* Julia
* Elixir
* Visi

So, since others have detected themes, I'd like to cover the ones that stuck out to me in the sessions I either attended, or desperately wanted to attend. Note to self: figure out that time travel thing.

## Strange Loop
## Functional is the new black
Clojure's coming out party
Monads as a joke
Functional design patterns
Relational Programming in miniKanren
core.logic

## Data is king
Stonebraker Polemic
Graph
Rich Hickey
Nathan Marz

Split into two topics: rethinking how we deal with data, and big data as a qualitative model, not quantitative one.

## JavaScript: It's not just for ads any more
Performance, building Java on JS, ClojureScript
Clojurescript: David Nolan
Lars Bak
Brenden Eich

## Better development tools

## Miscellaneous thoughts
Computer Architecture of the 60s
Audobon Society
Chris Granger: Light Table
Bret Victor: Taking off the Blindfold
Party @ Schlafly

One thing that struck me, and perhaps I'm biased, is that [Clojure](http://clojure.org/) is no longer considered anything less than mainstream.  
I'm sure some of this is Alex Miller's influence, but the conference felt like a "coming out party" for the language.
People felt free to throw Clojure code up on the screen, discuss it on equal footing with any other language, and generally the assumption was that everyone either knew it, or had at least heard of it and poked at it. 
Seeing a room of 100+ people nearly all raise their hands when asked "who here uses Clojure?" was a bright spot.

We can't have all this unmitigated praise without a few minor critiques. 
Like most conferences, StrangeLoop badges look better than they work. 
They're sleek and cool, and completely unreadable from any distance past about 2 feet. 
In the future, I'd love the badges to have a very high contrast (black on white) and large space for someone's name, Twitter/Github handle and company. 
We all know we're at Strange Loop, we don't need a reminder.
Also, it seemed with a few presenters that visual style of their code subsumed readability.
Quite a few presenters had white code on a black background, which for various reasons, doesn't project well. 
Perhaps next year, the organizers can put out some guidance on how to format code for display? 

Finally, amazing organizer [Alex Miller](http://tech.puredanger.com/) deserves a heap of praise for stewarding 1,000 geeks and nerds through a well-run conference and keeping the intimate feel for things. 
The amount of work required to keep a conference on track and enjoyable is enormous and Alex, and his team, deserve massive praise for it.
