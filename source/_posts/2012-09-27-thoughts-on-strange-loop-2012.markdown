This year was the first year I was able to attend [Strange Loop](http://www.thestrangeloop.com). Every other year it was held, something interfered. Sometimes it was work, and sometimes life. Regardless, I've resolved never to let that happen again. It has become -- by far -- my favorite conference. It blends humor, intelligence, and mind-bending ideas in a stew that is tasty, filling, and exhausting in the way that good discourse should be.

It's also the first year that conference was held in the [Peabody Opera House](http://peabodyoperahouse.com/), which provided a stunning backdrop for all the conversations.  How can you not marvel at Jeff Hawkins [brilliant talk](https://thestrangeloop.com/sessions/computing-like-the-brain) on "computing like the brain" delivered in a gilded City Beautiful creation?  The staff were gracious and helpful, and things ran as smoothly as any conference of that size can be expected to.

## Emerging Languages Camp
Power of JS as a target
Elm as a teaching aid
Datalog
Julia
Elixir

So, since others have detected themes, I'd like to cover the ones that stuck out to me in the sessions I either attended, or desperately wanted to attend. Note to self: figure out that time travel thing.

## Strange Loop
## Functional is the new black
Clojure's coming out party
Monads as a joke
Functional design patterns
Relational Programming in miniKanren
core.logic

## Data is king
Stonebraker Polemic
Graph
Rich Hickey
Nathan Marz

Split into two topics: rethinking how we deal with data, and big data as a qualitative model, not quantitative one.

## JavaScript: It's not just for ads any more
Performance, building Java on JS, ClojureScript
Clojurescript: David Nolan
Lars Bak
Brenden Eich

## Miscellaneous thoughts
Computer Architecture of the 60s
Audobon Society
Chris Granger: Light Table
Bret Victor: Taking off the Blindfold
Party @ Schlafly

Finally, amazing organizer [Alex Miller]() deserves a heap of praise for stewarding 1,000 geeks and nerds through a well-run conference and keeping the intimate feel for things.
