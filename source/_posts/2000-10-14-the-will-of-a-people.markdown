So here we sit, November 14, 2000, a week after the 2000 elections are
â€œover,â€? and we’re still not totally sure who won. This presents an
interesting opportunity to look not just at the process, but more
importantly the people who ran as well as the people who vote.

What does it say about our country and political system when the best
two candidates we could find are Al Gore and George W. Bush? Is this
really the best this country has to offer the world?

On the one hand we have a rather arrogant politician, in all the poorest
sense of the word, continually changing his position to dodge and parry
the opponent and try and nullify the differences. So bland that you
almost feel the need to reach for a salt shaker every time he comes on
television to tell you what you want to hear.

On the other hand, we have an ill-informed, badly educated and rather
underwhelming intellect who claims to be a "compassionate
conservative"? all the while having his twitchy trigger finger on the
execution switch of Texas. How does one rationalize the two? Or does one
not bother when one can’t understand that the two are countermanded by
the one thing that does matter to the man, "power"? The accidental
success story. The failure up until 40. The man who thinks that DUI is a
"youthful" issues. If a boy can be tried as an adult at 16, then 30
is no longer youth.

And so through all the election process -- a term I use in its
loosest form -- we receive these two examples: mediocrity in excess. We
are left, the populace, to choose someone not because of who they are,
but for who they are not. This is not the decision of a democracy, but
of a system bent on its own purpose, not the direct reflection of the
political feelings of a nation as diverse as the planet it exists on. I
hear on the streets the rantings of "No more Clinton/Gore"? next to
the shrill cries against Bush, all campaigning against the opponent, but
never able to build a case for their own candidate. A sad state indeed.

And so we vote, a people tired of the droning of hundereds of millions
in advertising, and the politicians wonder "what is the will of the
people?" The will of the people is obvious: We have no will. In a
country where voter turnout sometimes is as low as 10%, and rarely
passes 50%, can we really know what the people want? Apathy is a vote,
no less valid than a vote for Nader, but does anyone listen? Give us
passion, give us something and someone to believe in.

So where does that leave us? A country adrift in mediocrity. A country
led by individuals without the strength of character, nor the will of
vision to take the country anywhere. It is as if the ship is adrift in
the sea, and the captain simply stands there saying â€œit is the will of
the sea that we go there.â€? It is not the will of the sea, it is the
will of the people that must be followed. Democracy is a precious cargo,
one that should not be entrusted to a mediocre captain, and yet it is
the people who find their captain, and so it is, in the end, we who
fail.
