In July of last year, I special ordered a [Ford Focus ST](http://www.ford.com/cars/focus/focusst/). 
At the time, it had just been announced, and I hadn't even driven one.
Instead, my decision was based on the reputation of the previous generation of Focus ST and RS, and the quality of the current [third generation Focus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Focus_(third_generation)).
Getting an order in was, shall we say, less than easy, as most dealers weren't used to pre-ordering things, and I often knew much more about the process than they did.
Still, in November of late year, I took delivery of an Oxford White 2013 Focus ST.

So, after six months with the car, I decided that it's about time to put together my thoughts.
The good and the bad, though the good far outweigh the bad.


## The Bad

I have to start with the dreadful [MyFord Touch](http://www.ford.com/technology/sync/) system, "designed" by Microsoft.
It's not the worst user interface I've ever seen, but it is slow, sometimes oddly unresponsive, and periodically requires some kind of maintenance reboot, sometimes in the middle of a drive. 
Enough has been written about the system that I don't need to go into it more here; suffice it to say that it's not Microsoft's finest hour.
Fortunately, as a small redeemly grace, there has been a code release that was downloadable, and I was able to upgrade the software.
The upgrade increased performance a little bit, and generally made the system more stable.
Unfortunately, the system -- even though it's capable of connecting to a WiFi network in your house -- is unable to download its own updates directly, and instead you have to download them, stick them on a USB drive and sit in the car for the entire time with the engine running while it does an update, which can take an hour.

The next three issues are all tied together.
Rear-facing visibility is sub-optimal.
It's certainly worse than my Mazda 3, and comes with some serious blind spots.
Unfortunately, unlike the Titanium model of the Focus, you can't get the ST with either ultrasonic parking sensors, or a back-up camera.
This is a gigantic, glaring oversight.

The last big issue is the dealer.
No matter how much the domestic car makes improve their product -- and they have made gigantic strides -- the dealers are still sub-par at best.
They fail on sales; they fail on service; and they fail in general communication.


## The Good

As I said, the good far outweight the bad for me. For the good, I'm going to just hit them in bullet points:

* Handling is Teutonic. The handling is more like that of a BMW than anything you've ever run into with a domestic car before. The limits are very high, with the car pulling close to 1G on the skid pad. That's serious sports-car territory.
* Oversteer. Yes, Virginia, you can hang the tail out of a front-wheel-drive car. The tuning of the stability system, and the chassis as a whole mean that you can create lift-off oversteer on demand if you put the suspension in sport mode.
* Brakes are excellent. They're not fancy Brembo brakes, but even a day in the mountains doesn't cause any fade, and the initial bite is excellent. Pedal feel is outstanding. They are comparable to my Infinti G35 w/Brembo brakes.
* Engine is a locomotive. 270ft-lbs of torque from just off idle, and it just
pulls. The performance curve is not that of a turbo-charged 4 cylinder, but more like a straight 6, or even a nice old-school V8.  There is minimal turbo lag.
* Sounds great. Unlike most "great sounding cars", though, it's all intake noise coming through a special Sound Symposer system. It's a butterfly valve that lets some of the intake noise into the cabin, but only when you step on it. Otherwise, nothing.
* Sleeper and a car for hooning around. I don't know how else to describe it other than Jekkyl and Hyde. Keep your foot out of the "go fast" pedal, and the car is a quiet, well mannered, cruiser. Step on it, and you can do all sorts of things that your parents would never approve of. For me, this is the greatest asset of the car.
